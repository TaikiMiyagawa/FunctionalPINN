# 1. Introduction: Overall architecture

The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1.
We first approximate functional differential equations (FDEs) using the cylindrical approximation, leading to high-dimensional PDEs (we implement these PDEs), which are then solved with PINNs (Figure 3).

# 2. Requirements

Please see [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) and run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install exactly the same libraries used in our environment. All the libraries, however, are not necessary if you just want to run `./train.py`. Specifically, we used:

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch 2.2.0
- Numpy 1.26.0

# 3. Training

`$ python train.py`

# 4. Files and Directories

- [`./configs`](./configs)
- [`./dataprocesses`](./dataprocesses)
- [`./losses`](./losses)
- [`./models`](./models)
- [`./optimizers`](./optimizers)
- [`./utils`](./utils)
- [`./train.py`](./train.py)
