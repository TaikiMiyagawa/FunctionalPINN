# Functional PINN
This is the official implementation of physics-informed neural networks for functional differential equations (Functional PINN) proposed in ["Physics-informed Neural Networks for Functional Differential Equations: Cylindrical Approximation and Its Convergence Guarantees", NeurIPS 2024].

WIP

Will be opend by mid November.
