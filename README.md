# Functional PINN
Work in progress! Please use [`./full_code`](./full_code) for now, which is the code submitted to OpenReview.

This is the official implementation of physics-informed neural networks for functional differential equations (Functional PINN) proposed in ["Physics-informed Neural Networks for Functional Differential Equations: Cylindrical Approximation and Its Convergence Guarantees", NeurIPS 2024].
